# IN4400

A demographic exploration of the Netherlands using Excel 2013 with Powermap

## About the course

[Programming & Data Analysis for the 99%](http://www.felienne.com/in4400) is focused on non-developers trying to get a feeling for programming and data analysis.
Even though, I decided to take the course as an actual Computer Science Student.

## Result

In this repository I've made my report, spreadsheet, and screencast public.
I hope it will be of any value to anyone.
All data is publicly available from the [Dutch CBS institute](http://www.cbs.nl), and can be downloaded from [Statline](http://statline.cbs.nl).

For this research I have used Excel 2013 on Windows, because I wanted to use the new Powermap features (they looked really cool!).
In order to use these, an additional research topic was required: How good is your first intuition regarding some demographic data?
